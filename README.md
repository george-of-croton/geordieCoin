## Sh*t Coin aka "geordieCoin" aka there's not actually any coins involved...

#### Why do it?
Why do anything? No, sorry that was a rude response... Mainly, I'm just not that smart and no matter how much I read about blockchain, I couldn't really comprehend it. So, I made this very very very very x 10000 simple interpretation of a blockchain. Am I any smarter? Doubtful. Did it occupy me for an afternoon. Yes.

#### Is it legit?
No. let there be no pretense of anonymity, security or reliability. It's just a server that can ask another server whether they've got the same file.

#### Can I use it?
Uh maybe. Not sure why you would but if you configure the http requests correctly you could run a chain with two peers.

#### todo
tests
command interface for adding and reading blocks
Add a directory of known peers that gets updated when an unknown peer asks for the chain for the first time
update the notify() function to handle many peers
introduce some sort of currency and wallet system
